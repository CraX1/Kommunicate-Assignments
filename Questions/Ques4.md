The best project I have worked on is a Netflix Clone.
A Netflix clone with login functionality. A working Plan Screen with an option to take subscription and test mode payment gateway.
The screen also showcases the plan you are currently on.
Languages used- Html, CSS, ReactJs, Redux,,Router, firebase, used TMDB API to fetch data, STRIPE API to carry on a dummy payment and get subscription details.
