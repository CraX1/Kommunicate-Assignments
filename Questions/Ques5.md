The two people I will choose from my batch if I start a software company will be - Aryan Tiwari (RA1911003030011) & Kushal Jain (RA1911026030047) 
because we have already worked on some projects to help each other out and we also are proficient in our own
domains like Aryan Tiwari is well skilled at data science and machine learning and Kushal Jain also knows a lot about
the Frontend part. 
As a software company requires the latest technology, we are well equipped with the skills required to manage and run the company 
smoothly.
